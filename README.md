# Hi, welcome to my Github! 👨🏻‍💻
I'm Michael Lo, a student pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at University of California, Riverside.

### Experience
I have two summers of internship experience. At Liferay, I worked on refactoring a client's website and migrating the site over to the Liferay platform. At my next internship, I built out the login flow and frontend of an iOS app in Swift and Mapbox. I also led product management meetings for the engineering team, prioritizing features using customer interviews.
