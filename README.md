I'm a software engineer 

### Experience
I have two summers of internship experience. At Liferay, I worked on refactoring a client's website and migrating the site over to the Liferay platform. At my next internship, I led the initial development of a social networking mobile app. I also led product management meetings for the engineering team, prioritizing features using customer interviews.
