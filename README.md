## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Michael Lo, a current third-year at University of California, Riverside pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science with Business Applications.

### Experience
I have two summers of internship experience. At Liferay, I worked on refactoring a client's website and migrating the site over to the Liferay portal. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript primarily. At Ayygo, I built out the front-end of the iOS app in Swift and Mapbox. I also led product management meetings for the engineering team, prioritizing features using customer interviews.
